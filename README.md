# GitFlip

Manage and switch between multiple GitHub accounts in VS Code — choose HTTPS, SSH, or git config only. No SSH setup required.

## Features

- **Auth Method Selector** — Choose how each profile authenticates: HTTPS (PAT), SSH key, or just git config
- **HTTPS Mode** — Use a Personal Access Token with git credential helpers. No SSH setup needed — perfect for beginners
- **SSH Mode** — Full SSH key management with `~/.ssh/config` host aliases and automatic remote URL switching
- **Git Config Only** — Just switch `user.name` and `user.email` without any auth configuration
- **Profile Management** — Create profiles for each GitHub account with name, email, auth method, and avatar
- **One-Click Switching** — Switch between profiles from the status bar, command palette, or sidebar
- **Inline CRUD Actions** — Edit, duplicate, and delete profiles directly from the sidebar
- **Profile Avatars** — Upload an image or paste a GitHub avatar URL for each profile
- **Token Storage** — Securely stores GitHub PATs using VS Code's encrypted secret storage
- **Token Validation** — Verifies HTTPS tokens against the GitHub API on save, so bad or expired tokens are caught before your next push
- **Drift Detection** — Warns in the status bar (and via **GitFlip: Check Current Repository**) when a repo's git identity doesn't match the active profile
- **Webview Sidebar** — Rich profile cards with avatars, auth badges (SSH/HTTPS), active indicator, and inline actions
- **Status Bar** — Shows the active profile at a glance; click to switch

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hamad-javed.gitflip)
2. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **GitFlip: Add Profile**
3. Fill in your GitHub account details
4. Choose an authentication method:
   - **Git Config Only** — Just set user.name and email
   - **HTTPS (Token)** — Enter a GitHub PAT for push/pull authentication
   - **SSH Key** — Select an SSH key and host alias
5. Switch profiles from the status bar or the GitFlip sidebar

## Authentication Methods

### HTTPS (Personal Access Token)

The easiest way to get started. GitFlip stores your PAT securely and configures git's credential helper automatically when you switch profiles.

1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Add a profile in GitFlip and select **HTTPS (Personal Access Token)**
3. Paste your token — it's encrypted using your OS keychain
4. When you switch to this profile, GitFlip sets your git config and configures the credential helper so push/pull works immediately

### SSH Key

For advanced users who prefer SSH authentication. GitFlip manages `~/.ssh/config` entries and updates remote URLs automatically.

1. Add a profile and select **SSH Key**
2. Browse for your SSH private key and set a host alias
3. GitFlip adds the entry to `~/.ssh/config` and rewrites remote URLs when you switch

### Git Config Only

Just switches `user.name` and `user.email` — no authentication setup. Useful when you only need to change the commit author identity.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `GitFlip: Add Profile` | Create a new GitHub account profile |
| `GitFlip: Switch Profile` | Switch to a different profile |
| `GitFlip: Edit Profile` | Edit an existing profile |
| `GitFlip: Remove Profile` | Delete a profile |
| `GitFlip: Duplicate Profile` | Duplicate an existing profile |
| `GitFlip: Show Current Profile` | Display the active profile details |
| `GitFlip: Check Current Repository` | Compare the current repo's git identity against the active profile |

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gitflip.defaultScope` | `local` | Default git config scope (`local` or `global`) |
| `gitflip.alwaysUseDefaultScope` | `false` | Skip the scope prompt inside a repo and always apply `defaultScope` (avoids accidentally writing to global and shadowing local config) |
| `gitflip.autoSwitchRemote` | `true` | Auto-update remote URL format (SSH host alias or HTTPS) when switching profiles |

## Sidebar

The GitFlip sidebar displays all your profiles as rich cards with:

- **Profile avatar** — custom image or default icon
- **Active badge** — green border and "Active" label for the current profile
- **Auth badges** — SSH or HTTPS indicator
- **Inline actions** — Switch, Edit, Duplicate, and Delete buttons on every card

## How It Works

### Git Config
When you switch profiles, GitFlip runs `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` with the selected profile's values. You choose whether to apply this to the current repository (local) or globally.

### HTTPS Credentials
For HTTPS profiles, GitFlip configures the **current repository** so it authenticates as the selected account:

- The repo's `origin` remote is rewritten to `https://<username>@github.com/owner/repo.git` so git knows which account to use.
- `credential.useHttpPath` is enabled locally so multiple GitHub accounts don't collide in the credential store.
- Your PAT is fed into the credential helper for that username/host.
- If no credential helper is configured, GitFlip sets a repo-local `credential.helper store` fallback rather than touching your global config.

Because credentials are scoped per repository and per username, switching profiles in one repo never breaks authentication in another. Remote rewriting only applies to `github.com` remotes — other hosts are left untouched.

### SSH Keys
For SSH profiles with a key and host alias, GitFlip adds an entry to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host github-work
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

When switching with `autoSwitchRemote` enabled, the repository's remote URL is updated to match the auth method (e.g., `git@github-work:user/repo.git` for SSH, `https://github.com/user/repo.git` for HTTPS).

### Token Storage
Personal Access Tokens are stored using VS Code's `SecretStorage` API, which encrypts them using the OS keychain.

### Profile Avatars
Avatars can be set via file upload (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, WebP) or by pasting a URL (e.g., your GitHub avatar URL). Uploaded images are stored as data URIs alongside the profile.
